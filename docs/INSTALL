Following commands have been tested on Ubuntu 14.0.4 LTS 32-bit.
(64-bit versions of Ubuntu might raise errors while building GCC since some headers and libraries are not stable or/and are different in 64-bit and 32-bit versions)

You should have GCC and G++ 4.8.0 or above installed on your system.

You need to set up cross compilers for x86 as well as x64 architectures.
We will be using GCC compiler suite.
Grab source code for GCC from one of the mirrors listed at https://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html
The instructions for installation are available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install

Recommended versions of softwares:
gcc 5.2.0
binutils 2.25.1
gmp 4.3.2
mpfr 2.4.2
mpc 0.8.1
isl 0.14

Extract all the archives.
Place gmp, mpfr, mpc and isl folders in the gcc source code directory.
Your directory tree should look something like:
|--binutils
|--gcc
  |--mpfr
  |--mpc
  |--gmp
  |--isl

Remove all the version numbers from folder names of mpfr, gmp, mpc, gcc, binutils and isl.
Follow the instructions given at http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler.

Your targets should be:
i686-elf
x86_64

Follow the instructions given on the page separately for each mentioned target.
Remove any intermediate directories that were made during installation.

Suppose your installation directories are:
/path/gcc5_2_i686
/path2/gcc5_2_x86_64
add them to your PATH environment variable using
export PATH="$PATH:<your_path>"

To make the PATH variable persist across sessions, add the above command to your .bashrc file (or your shell's configuration file that runs every time you log in).

Now you need to install NASM.
Run the following command:
sudo apt-get install nasm

Change your current directory to the root of this repository.
Run the following commands:
(To remove all extra files)
make clean

(To generate the ISO file for the OS)
make directories (only after make clean)
make all
