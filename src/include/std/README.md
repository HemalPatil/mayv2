# C++ standard headers

Most of the header contents are taken shamelessly from the GCC 11 headers provided for Ubuntu 22.04.  
All the credit goes to the (much smarter than me) original authors of the GCC headers.  
  
The only requirement to make these work is to have working `new` and `delete` operators.  
  
There may be cases where some headers are edited to make them work for the freestanding case like no RTTI and exceptions.
